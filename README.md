# secondarypreregistration
Will update this with information on how to use the template. 

For now, the most important thing to know is that it is an adaptation of the fine work done by Olmo van den Akker, Sarah J Weston and colleagues. Find the OSF documents that can be forked to create your own preregistration here:

and find the arxiv preprint (a detailed and informative tutorial) here:

## How to Use this Template
You can install the latest version os the package containing the by using the following code:
`devtools::install_github(http://github.com/nattonge/secondarypreregistration)`

Once installed, go to:
  + File -> New File -> New R Markdown
  + Select "From Template" on the left
  + Find Secondary Data Preregistration template in the list
  + Create a new document
  
### General Notes and tips
The template probably looks the best in html since there are number of levels in the table of contents. To edit the levels, you can add `toc_depth: 1` to have fewer levels in the table of contents. 

This is my first template/package/time using github so comments and suggestions for improvements are greatly appreciated!
