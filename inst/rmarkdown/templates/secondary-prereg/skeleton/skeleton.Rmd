**Moment of Preregistration**  
<!--Preregistration is designed to make clear the distinction between confirmatory tests, specified prior to seeing the data, and exploratory analyses conducted after observing the data. Therefore, creating a research plan in which existing data will be used presents unique challenges. It is very important that you specify the exact moment of the preregistration. Please select the description that best describes your situation. For example, if you will be using longitudinal data in a national panel study that has not been collected, select “Registration prior to creation of data.” If you are using data that will be provided by a private organization, and people there have already looked at the data, but your team has not accessed it, pick “Registration prior to accessing the data.” Please do not hesitate to contact Center for Open Science if you have questions about how to answer this question (prereg@cos.io).-->

*Response options:*     

$\Box$  Registration prior to creation of data  

$\Box$  Registration prior to any human observation of the data  

$\Box$  Registration prior to any researcher on this team accessing the data  

$\Box$  Registration prior to any researcher on this team handling or analysis of the data  

$\Box$  Registration after data cleaning, but before any main analyses  

$\Box$  Registration following analysis of the data  

# Current Study: Variables

## Manipulated variables

$\Box$ Not Applicable
<!-- Identify the manipulated variables you plan to use. Describe these  variables and the levels or treatment arms of each variable. For observational studies and meta-analyses, simply state that this is not applicable. If you are collapsing groups across variables, this should be explicitly stated and the formula provided.-->

## Measured variables  
<!--Describe each variable that was measured. This will include outcome measures, as well as any predictors or covariates that were measured. You do not need to include any variables that are included in the dataset if they are not going to be included in the confirmatory analyses of this study. Describe in as much detail as possible-->
*Enter your response here*

## Scales  
<!--Description: A scale is a measure of a construct that includes at least two items. These items are then aggregated into a smaller set of scores which are then incorporated into statistical models.  If you are using a scale, what construct does this scale represent? (Describe a single scale here. You will have the opportunity to add additional scales if needed.)-->

$\Box$  N/A

**Please indicate which variables in the data set will be used to create this scale. Add a new line for each scale you will create or use. **

*Enter your response here*

**How will the variables will be aggregated? **  

*Options:*   

$\Box$ Mean score  

$\Box$ Sum score   

$\Box$ Weighted mean or weighted sum (provide more detail about how weights will be determined below)  

$\Box$ Exploratory Factor Analysis (provide more detail below, e.g., rotation, how number of factors will be determined, how best fit will be             selected)  

$\Box$ Structural Equation Modeling/CFA (provide more detail below, e.g., how loadings will be specified, how fit will be assessed, which                 residuals variance terms will be correlated)  

$\Box$ Other (provide more detail)  

**Is this aggregation is based on recommendations from the study codebook or validation research?** 

$\Box$ Yes
        *Detail:*
        
$\Box$ No (if yes, provide detail above)

## Index/Indices 

$\Box$  Not Applicable

<!--An index is an indicator of a value or quantity. For example, an exam score is an indicator of a student’s understanding of course material. If you are using or creating an index, please indicate which variables in the data set will be used to create this index, how those variables exactly will be aggregated, what you believe this variable or aggregation represents, and whether this aggregation is based on recommendations from the study codebook or validation research.-->

<!--Example: We will take the mean of the two questions above to create a single measure of ‘brownie enjoyment.’ -->

## Transformations

<!--Description: If you plan on transforming, centering, recoding the data, or will require a coding scheme for categorical variables, please describe that process.-->

Options: 

$\Box$  Grand mean centering  
$\Box$  Group mean centering  
$\Box$  Standardizing  
$\Box$  Log (log e)  
$\Box$  Log (base 10)

*Or Enter your response here*

## Weights

$\Box$  Not Applicable
**Are there sampling weights available with this data set? If so, are you using them and how?**

## Sample size
<!--What is the sample size (to the best of your knowledge)? For each of your research questions, what is the smallest effect size you will consider meaningful? How much power will you have to detect each of those effects?-->

## Missing data 
<!--Description: What do you know about missing data in the data set already (e.g., overall missingness rate, information about differential dropout)? How will you deal with incomplete or missing data?-->
*Enter your response here*

# Current Study : Analyses

*Enter your response here*

## Statistical Models  
<!--Description: For each hypotheses, describe the statistical model will you use to test the hypothesis. Please include the type of model (e.g. ANOVA, multiple regression, SEM, etc) and the specification of the model (this includes each variable that will be included as predictors, outcomes, or covariates). Please specify any interactions and post-hoc analyses that will be tested and remember that any test not included here must be noted as an exploratory test in your final article.-->
*Enter your response here*

## Follow-up analyses  
<!-- If not specified previously, will you be conducting any confirmatory analyses to follow-up on effects in your statistical model, such as subgroup analyses, pairwise or complex contrasts, or follow-up tests from interactions? Remember that any analyses not specified in this research plan must be noted as exploratory.-->
*Enter your response here*

## Inference criteria  
*Enter your response here*
<!--What criteria will you use to make inferences? Please describe the information you’ll use (e.g. specify the p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, Bayes factors, specific model fit indices), as well as cut-off criterion, where appropriate. Will you be using one or two tailed tests for each of your analyses? If you are comparing multiple conditions or testing multiple hypotheses, will you account for this?-->

## Sensitivity Analyses 

$\Box$  N/A

<!--Provide a series of decisions about evaluating the strength, reliability, or robustness of your focal hypothesis test. This may include additional control variables, cross-validation efforts (out-of-sample replication, spilt/hold-out sample), any machine learning application/analyses, applying weights, selectively applying constraints in an SEM context (e.g., comparing model fit statistics), any alpha or multiple comparison adjustments, overfitting adjustment techniques used (e.g., regularization approaches such as ridge regression), or some other simulation/sampling/bootstrapping.-->
*Enter your response here*

### Statistical Analysis Backup Plan
<!--Describe what you will do should your data violate assumptions, your model not converge, or some other analytic problem arise? -->

$\Box$  N/A <!-- are you sure you don't want a backup plan?-->

## Exploratory analysis  
<!--If you plan to explore your data set to look for unexpected differences or relationships, you may describe those tests here. An exploratory test is any test where a prediction is not made up front, or there are multiple possible tests that you are going to use. A statistically significant finding in an exploratory test is a great way to form a new confirmatory hypothesis, which could be registered at a later time in a different dataset.-->

#  Preregistration
Preregistration is designed to make clear the distinction between confirmatory tests, specified prior to seeing the data, and exploratory analyses conducted after observing the data. Therefore, creating a research plan in which existing data will be used presents unique challenges. It is very important that you specify the exact moment of the preregistration.

If you’re uncertain about what preregistration is, or if you should do it, read about it [here](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg).

The good news is, if you’ve made it this far, most of this document can be used to create your preregistration! See more information about Secondary Data Preregistration and Resources for making your own [here](https://osf.io/x4gzt/).
