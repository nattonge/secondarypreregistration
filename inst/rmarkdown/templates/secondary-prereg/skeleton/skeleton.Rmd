# Study Information

## Title
<!--Provide the working title of your study. It is helpful if this is the same title that you submit for publication of your final manuscript, but it is not a requirement.-->

Project Title

## Author Information
<!--Tips: 
1. Expand the Source window to the right to view the entire table at once. The lines don't have to align for the final document to format. 
2. For preregistration, also list author ORCID ids and emails. 
3. Entering the proposed role for the each author is a good way to keep track of author contributions.
4. Author agreements or contracts are negotiable but can be helpful to state upfront. 
See https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2015/06/determining-authorship for examples-->

##Research Question
<!--Please list each research question included in this study using secondary data. Include only one question per line to make it easier to keep track of your hypotheses. 
For each of the research questions listed, provide one or multiple specific and testable hypotheses, or one or more specific estimates related to those research questions. If doing hypothesis testing, please state if the hypotheses are directional or non-directional. If directional, state the direction. A predicted effect is also appropriate here. Provide that information under Rationale-->

**Research Question 1**

1) Hypothesis 1.1 (related to RQ1)
    i) Statistical test of hypothesis 1.1
    i) Statistical test of hypothesis 1.1
2) Hypothesis 1.2 (related to RQ1)
